Reinforcement learning (RL) is a machine learning method where an agent takes actions to interact with an environment in order to reach a 
state of high reward. This area of machine learning is different than other more traditional types of machine learning (e.g. supervised learning)
because the agent makes multiple decisions before a reward is assigned. While already proven highly effective in strategy based games 
(i.e. DeedMind’s AlphaGo and OpenAI’s Five) and achieving industrial success in content recommendation, it is believed my many researchers 
that RL will eventually solve the problems of robotics, autonomous driving, and artificial general intelligence.
